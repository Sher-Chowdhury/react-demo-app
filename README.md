# react-demo-app
Just a demo app for learning purposes


React is used to describe user interfaces. Hence react is declarative. 

Why react?

pros of using react:

-  can use "virtual browser" instead of DOM API which is a little harder.
- can be used for building mobile apps
- It's a declarative language (model UI and state)


In react, we used "components" to describe UI. Components are actually very similar to javascript functions.


Like functions, components have "inputs" and "outputs".
The inputs are:

- props (aka properties)
- state

And the outputs are:
- UI

components are reusable, and components can contain other components.

You simply call react components from within html code, using this html-like syntax:

```
<component />
```

I.e. we can embed components like a regular html element.

components can store private state data, for it's component's lifetime.

React is reactive, i.e. when the (private) "state" (input) changes, then the UI (output) changes as well.

This means, react works a bit like ajax, if you fill in some text fields, it can automatically show a preview elsewhere without need to refresh the page. 


We don't actually write any html code, javascript/react will automatically generate the html code for us. 

Instead we do write jsx code, that looks very similar to html code. This jsx is what component (functions) ends up returning. 


A react component can be written in the form of a:

- Function component
- Class component

But function component is recommended because it is relatively simpler.

A component accepts two input parameters:

- props (this contains fixed values)
- states (this is used to hold changing values)

This means components can make changes to states, but not props. 

and one return value. This value looks like a bit of html code, but it's actually a special syntax called jsx. 

React takes this jsx code and generates javascript code. This javascript code is what then get's processed by the web brower's builtin javascript engine, into html code.  


There's 2 ways to create a new react project.

1. create-react-app - https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
2. manually. 

### create-react-app approach

https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app

There's 2 ways:

```
npm -i -g create-react-app
create-react-app 01-my-hello-world-app
```

but a better approach is:

```
npx create-react-app 01-my-hello-world-app
```

`npx` just downloads the latest `create-react-app` binary and uses it. npx always gets the latest version. So you don't have to worry about getting the latest version. Here's what the output looks like:

```

```

note: the "x" in `npm` means "execute", i.e. we want to execute a node package.  

```
npx create-react-app 01-my-hello-world-app

npx: installed 67 in 26.281s

Success! Created 01-my-hello-world-app at /Users/sherchowdhury/github/react-demo-app/01-my-hello-world-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd 01-my-hello-world-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
```

this ends up creating the following folder and contents:

```
cd 01-my-hello-world-app

`-I` is to ignore the node_module's folder. 

The package.json shows the make up of this project:

```
cat package.json 
{
  "name": "01-my-hello-world-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {

    "@testing-library/react": "^13.1.1",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  },

      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```


You can now start it up

```
npm start
```


Here's what the `src/App.js` looks like:

```js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Notice the `import` statements pulls in non-node-packages, e.g. css. That's possible because this app comes with a lot of built in configurations to make that possible. To see all these hidden configurations, run the exect command:

```
npm run eject

> 01-my-hello-world-app@0.1.0 eject /Users/sherchowdhury/github/react-demo-app/01-my-hello-world-app
> react-scripts eject

NOTE: Create React App 2+ supports TypeScript, Sass, CSS Modules and more without ejecting: https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/10/01/create-react-app-v2.html

In particular see how the package.json has changed - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/react-demo-app/commit/fcbba5d740b07c7b156253c3ce9487181030fbbd#diff-e0e8246784d4f8be8414321166cbbc3aa4398a20b43a57d1d5bcc197d074e7f7

It essentially removed the wrapper tool and replaced it with the core underlying code. 

A project setup like this is pretty much overkill, and you're unlikely to need all these features. 


## Manually create a project

It's recommended to follow this guide - https://jscomplete.com/learn/1rd-reactful



```
$ mkdir 02-my-hello-world-app

$ cd 02-my-hello-world-app

$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

}


Is this OK? (yes) yes
```

This creates the `package.json` file, ref - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/react-demo-app/commit/9e5a12bc97ca50e39146a209c67c73008c74ec66


Now run:

```
npm install express
```

This downloads the `express` into the node_modules folder, and also adds express to the packages.json dependencies section. 

ref - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/react-demo-app/commit/1702ec1d5bc8b8e3c406e070f2759fab70b30075

now run

```
npm install react react-dom
npm install webpack webpack-cli
npm install npm i babel-loader @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

- react - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react
- react-dom - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom - This takes all the jsx code, and renders it to standard html+javascript code that web browsers understands (actually I think it's react api calls). 

- webpack - https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack - this bundles all the js code into a single file. 
- webpack-cli - https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli - This provides the webpack binary. 

- babel - converts react's jsx code into react-api calls. 

E.g. go to https://babeljs.io/ , then click "try it out", then enter `<h1>hello</h1>`. 


Optionally install this Dev dependency:

```
npm install -D nodemon
```

nodemon - - autoruns `npm stop ; npm start` app when any code changes are made.


I dont think this is needed when using the webstorm IDE. 


next install eslint - https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint

```
npm install -D eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks
```

now create the `.eslintrc.js` file - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/react-demo-app/commit/370e65a63542dfe9ae226e37fcc562ffe4daf522

then install a testing library. Mocha is very popular, but for react based apps, it's Jest that is normally used  

```
npm install -D jest babel-jest react-test-renderer
```

Ref - https://github.com/Sher-Chowdhury/react-demo-app/commit/bff2545c48aace013800f5fecd5b0d180e70e8c8


Now, need to create a folder structure to put all the code, this is up to you, but here's one approach:

```
mkdir -p reactful/dist
touch reactful/dist/main.js

mkdir reactful/src
touch reactful/src/index.js

mkdir reactful/components
touch reactful/components/app.js

mkdir reactful/server
touch reactful/server/server.js

tree reactful
reactful
├── components
│   └── app.js
├── dist
│   └── main.js
├── server
│   └── server.js     # write backend code here. E.g. express related code
└── src
    └── index.js
```

Now create this 2 top level files:

```
touch babel.config.js
touch webpack.config.js
```

`webpack` by default looks for a `src/index.js` and bundles the code. By default it will output this bundle to `dist/main.js`.

That's why we have created the above folder structure, so that we can stick with these defaults, rather than overriding them with custom configs.
